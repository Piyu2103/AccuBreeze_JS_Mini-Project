# AccuBreeze_JS_Mini-Project
AccuBreeze is a weather fetching forecast WebApp.

• Users can enter or share their location and view the forecast, which is rendered using handlebars.

• Location entered by the user will be geocoded through MapBox API to its latitude and longitude, which facilitates
WeatherAPI to fetch the forecast.
